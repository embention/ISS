👉 This repository has been created with the intention of solving all the possible errors that our clients may encounter when using our applications.

👉 To make this possible, the feedback functionality has been added to the applications.

## 🧾 How does it work ❓

1️⃣ Within our applications we go to the feedback button.

2️⃣ A widget will open where we can enter the title about our problem.

3️⃣ We can take a screenshot and record a video to better show the problem occurred. 📸 📹

4️⃣ Once we have the capture and the desired video, we proceed to click on the send button. 📤

5️⃣ A github issue template will open where we can better write the problem in the body of the issue.

6️⃣ To better understand what caused the problem, drag the downloaded zip, image and video into the body of the issue. 📥

7️⃣ Once everything has been entered and the issue has been written, it is time to add the labels. 🏷️

8️⃣ Finally, all you have to do is click on the submit new issue button. 📬

🌟 Our engineers will take care of solving the problem 🌟
